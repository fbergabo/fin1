Phys 2200 Final part 1

This program is an adaptation of an earlier program that used regular polygons to estimate pi with greater and greater precision. In the original program, there was a catastrophic loss of precision when the number of iterations became too high. In this program, the problem has been addressed and the loss of precision no longer occurs.

The reason for the precision loss in the initial program was due to the fact that the program was dealing with several very small numbers in the used relation. The relation has been corrected by taking the reciprocal of these very small numbers. The program is now dealing with large numbers and no longer suffers the same precision loss.

In order to run the program, download all of the files in the repository. Type the word "make" into the command line. This will create a .pdf file of a graph in the same folder. The graph will display the relative error as the approximation becomes closer and closer to the value of pi. The graph produced by this program shows the relative error converging, with no sudden catastrophic loss in precision.
